# Warp_Verilog_UART_Tx
Here I describe the steps required to implement Warp Verilog development with PSoC 5LP

Materials needed:

- CY8CKIT-059 PSoC 5LP Prototyping kit
- USB TTL converter

# First step: create a new project

The next steps are the bread-and-butter because is the process of creation a PSoC project.
File > New > Project...
Select the target kit as our kit PSoC 5LP, select blank schematic and name the workspace.
